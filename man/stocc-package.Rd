\title{R package for fitting spatial-temporal occupancy models via Gibbs sampling}
\description{
This package contains functions that fit a spatial occupancy model where the
true occupancy is a function of a spatial process.  An efficient Gibbs
sampling algorithm is used by formulating the detection and occupancy
process models with a probit model instead of the traditional logit based
model.
